I'll create a low-level system design that focuses on software architecture and implementation details that can run on your local computer, while maintaining the security principles from our high-level specification.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

I've created a detailed low-level system design for your secure messaging platform that can run on your local computer. This design focuses on software architecture and security protocols without relying on specialized physical hardware.

Key aspects of the design include:

1. **Client-Server Architecture**: A fully encrypted communication path with the server running locally on your machine using Docker containers

2. **End-to-End Encryption**: Implemented using a "Triple Ratchet" protocol (an extension of Signal's Double Ratchet) combined with post-quantum cryptography

3. **Zero-Knowledge Authentication**: Authentication without revealing actual credentials or keys

4. **Anti-Forensic Features**: Deniable storage with decoy data and duress passwords

5. **Memory Safety**: Secure management of cryptographic keys in memory with protection against swapping

6. **Efficient Local Deployment**: Docker containerization with minimal networking exposure

The design is modular, so you can implement it incrementally. You could start with the core cryptographic engine, then add the messaging protocol, and finally implement the authentication system.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific component of this design? Or would you prefer to see code examples for a particular functionality?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
